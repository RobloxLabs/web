A fan-made version of the 2013 ROBLOX website in ASP.NET Core. All of the code within this repository is my own.
The project and code structure present were intentionally designed to replicate ROBLOX's codebase layout based on once *publicly-accessible* stacktraces produced and displayed by their websites from the years 2010 to 2022. Any similarities in project structure, class names, or method names to any pre-existing codebases are likely due to the aforementioned.
